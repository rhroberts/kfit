<h1>kfit - Simple, graphical spectral fitting</h1>
</div>
<div>
kfit is a tool for quick and easy spectral fitting in science and education.
It works as a standalone data fitting program for simple tasks, or as an
exploratory tool in more complex projects. kfit provides a few commonly 
used peak shapes in engineering and physics, and will eventually support 
custom models.
