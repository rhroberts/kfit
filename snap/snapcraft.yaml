description: |
  kfit is a tool for quick and easy spectral fitting in science and education.
  It works as a standalone data fitting program for simple tasks, or as an
  exploratory tool in more complex projects. kfit provides a few commonly 
  used peak shapes in engineering and physics, and will eventually support 
  custom models.
